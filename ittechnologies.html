                  <h3> BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCIES </h3>
                  <h4> <i> WHAT DOES IT DO? </i> </h4>
                  <p> Blockchain  and  Cryptocurrency  are  incredibly  popular  nowadays  due  to  the  Bitcoin  mania paving the way in late 2013, when the price of Bitcoin climbed to $800 per coin. </p>

                  </figure>
                  <p> First, let’s start with Blockchain. Like the name itself  indicates,  it  is  a  chain  of  blocks  that contains detailed information and data in digital format and well known for playing a crucial role in  the  world  of  cryptocurrency.  Blockchain collects  information  together  in  groups,  known as  blocks,  that  hold  sets  of  information  which have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are  closed  and  linked  to  the  previously  filled block,  forming  a  chain  of  data  known  as  the blockchain   where   all   new   information   that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a  newly  formed  block  that  will  then  also  be added to the chain once filled; which primarily differs from a typical database in the way that it stores   information   due   to   implementing   a decentralized  nature  (Hayes,  2022).  When  the Internet    was    created    and    became    fully functional,  the  idea  of  Blockchain  has  been swirling around computer science communities but it was Satoshi Nakamoto who pseudonymously founded and developed Bitcoin that pushed the development of Blockchain and cemented it to where it is today when they outlined and implemented  the  blockchain  in  Bitcoin’s  white  paper.  As  a  result,  blockchain  technology became a huge innovative steppingstone that played an indispensable role of setting up many of the central features of these systems, which to this day still remains. Blockchain is also a shared,  immutable  ledger  that  facilitates  the  process  of  recording  transactions  and  tracking assets in a business network; an assetcan be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual  property,  patents,  copyrights,  branding)  or  virtually  anything  of  value  can  be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, supposedly reducing the risk, and cutting costs for all involved (IBM, 2022).
                  </p>
                  <figure>

                  <figcaption> &copy; Investopedia, 2022 </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <p> Due   to   the   creation   of   Blockchain,   it   enabled   the   existence   of   Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies  or  “Crypto”  are  digital  or  virtual  currencies  that  is  secured  and  allows transactions,  or  any  online  payments  to  go  through  without  the  presence  of  any  third-party intermediaries.  Most  cryptocurrencies  are  based  on  decentralized  blockchain  networks, potentially  giving  them  immunity  towards  any  government  and  central  bank  interference  or manipulations.  It  provides  a  one-of-a-kind  security  feature due  to  the  various  encryption algorithms  and  cryptographic  techniques  that  safeguard  multiple  entries,  such  as  elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions which are types of a widely used cryptographic security system to ultimately protect how we pass data between our data centres  (Frankenfield,  2021).  Cryptocurrency  can  be  acquired  through  mining  by  any participating  computer  with  an  allotted  graphics  card  unit  that  successfully  solves  a mathematical puzzle, however, it does require a huge amount of electricity and power usage. It  is  also  purchasable  through  cryptocurrency  exchanges  or  trading  applications  such  as Coinbase, Etoro, Binance, Crypto.com, and many more. Not all ecommerce websites allow the use cryptocurrency fortransactions, however, due to popular demand, you can now use crypto in some places to buy regular goods and/or services, as businesses continue to adapt to new technological advancements evident in today’s socioeconomic activities in the market.
                  </p>
                  <figure>
                  <img src="blockchainbenefits.webp" alt="Blockchain Benefits" style="width:700px;height:300px;">
                  <figcaption> &copy; Investopedia, 2022 </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <p> Generally, there are still numerous exciting possibilities for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency; it won’t take long, and it shouldn’t be dismissed. As cryptocurrency continues to successfully transform the way we buy, hold, and sell, it is highly plausible to conclude that there would be more advanced options readily available in the market for completing transactions, coming our way soon, worldwide. The same goes for Blockchain, as it continuously challenges the current status quo of innovation by letting multiple research and technological companies experiment with its ground-breaking technology to further evolve its use.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <i> WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT? </i> </h4>
                  <p> For  an  overview  of  Blockchain  and  Cryptocurrency,  it  all  leads  to  complete  accessibility, transparency, and trust, be it applied to government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), banks,  private  enterprises,  or  businesses.  Blockchain  is  an  enormous  database  that  is completely decentralized and runs on trust-based peer-2-peer network-meaning, no person or entity can control and/or manipulate it. It’s major selling point is openness, growth in cost and popularity,  and  its  irrefutable  record  keeping,  which  in  turn  radically  lowers  the  “cost  of trust.” <br><br>
                      For example, a recent report from the Guardian Seascape analysis found40% of fishbought in restaurants, markets, and from fishmongers around the world were mislabelled and, in some cases, contained traces of pig. There was no transparent supply chain. Imagine if blockchain tracked boats, catches, markets, and delivery? Due to this rising concerns, IBMhas partnered up  with  several  big  players  in  the  food  industry,using  blockchain  to  provide  a transparent supply  chain  for  produce.  This  builds  brand  trust,  and  people  can  check  if  labelling  and packaging are truthful. People can track every step of the supply chain and check, for instance, what pesticides were used, if it’s local food, and where it grew (Terrapass, 2021). <br><br>
                      Since the implementation of Cryptocurrency has been apparent to the public it cannot be denied that it made a huge impact in our economy and environment. It provides many incentives such as fostering trust within the market like never before because of its autonomy and conveniency; from a more inclusive and secured financial system to its market availability 24/7. However, the amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining is likely to increase over time, as user  adoption  of  crypto  increases  and  mining  efficiency  decreases  it  raises  environmental concerns to countries that must burn fossil fuels in order to generate electricity (Reiff, 2021). <br><br>
                      Nonetheless, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency has an inevitable massive potential considering its current momentum in the global and digitalized modern market, as it helps create a more technologically  advanced  future,  replace  the  traditional  way  of  making  and  processing transactions,  and  more  importantly,  shape  our  way  of  thinking  in  more  ways  that  we  could imagine.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <i> HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU? </i> </h4>
                  <p> Firstly, I would like to rephrase this question from ‘How will this affect you?’ to ‘How canthis affect you?’. Simply put, cryptocurrencies mostly affect the people who trade in them and the black market. They also create several issues that make cryptocurrency disliked by government departments  (such  as  regulation  difficulties,  tax  evasion,  black  market  trading,  openness  to volatility/market manipulation and scams), thus encouraging further and further regulations on their purchase and sales (TopBrokers, 2017). <br><br>
                      With that said, those who are capable traders (market ‘sharks’) have the opportunity to make quite a substantial income from their trade. One of our group's members, Jordan Glen, used to trade in cryptocurrencies for a living before moving on into other life ventures and keeping it as a hobby. In his words “todays’ Bitcoin market has grown to a size where more than doubling your investment is unlikely (in opposed to the famed history of over 1000% profits etc which were  known  to  make  millionaires),  and  whilst  there  are  smaller  markets  where  investing  in start-ups for example, still have the potential to make colossal amounts of money, they also have some of the greatest risk associated in the world of investments. Coming with many risks, if you don’t know what you’re doing, prepare to lose a large amount of money. It is very much a  world  of  the  rich  getting  rich  from  the  poor  not  knowing  how  to  effectively  manage  their funds. This is shown in fitting example from the activity of large banks and trading institutions joining the cryptocurrency market”. <br><br>
                      Blockchain on the other hand, is a revolutionary technology. People don’t necessarily realise this, but the use this technology is one that can affect (and greatly improve) not just those who invest  into  cryptocurrencies,  nor  the  businesses  that  benefit  from  it,  but  also  the  ‘everyday people’   who   wish   for   faster   and   more   efficient   healthcare   access,   greater   internet security/digital  profile  security,  with  even  the  possibility  enabled  for  online  voting  systems (Sharma, 2020). <br><br>
                      Other benefits of blockchain technologies include, but are not limited to decentralised social media  platforms,  immutable  digital  records  (used  for  contracts  or  signed  agreements/legal paperwork),    travel,    hospitality,    and    other    online    businesses,    and    further    online efficiency/reliability (Grybniak, 2021; Obijae, 2022). <br><br>
                      Meanwhile,  the  benefit  of  the  evolution  of cryptocurrencies  includes  lower  fees,  faster settlements,  international  use,  and  pre-discussed  possible  benefits  from  trading.  Again,  the cryptocurrencies side mainly affects those who participate in it (Cher, 2019).

                  <h3> CLOUD, SERVICES, SERVERS </h3>
                  <h4> <i> WHAT DOES IT DO? </i> </h4>
                  <p> The  current  state  of  Cloud  Services  show  that  enterprises  are  continuing  to  embrace  cloud strategies  and  move  away  from  traditional  on-premises  services,  “citing  the  higher-than-expected cloud usage was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions throughout 2020” (Luxner 2022), which saw a large global shift towards remote working. Cloud-based services were  a  critical  part  of  ensuring  businesses  were  able  to  quickly  adapt  to  the  changing  work environment on a global level. The current state of the technology provides reliable and secure access to IT resources over the internet. Some examples of this are Email Services, File Storage and  Sharing,  ERP  systems,  CRM  systems,  Project  Management  systems,  Messaging  and Communication services. Many of these services are also easily accessible from a smartphone device. From a consumer perspective, Cloud Services are continuing to seamlessly intertwine with our daily lives such as social media, Messaging and Communication services, Audio and Video streaming services. <br><br>
                      In the next 3 years, we are likely to see continued adoption of cloud services in our professional and personal lives and impact it to the point where it becomes almost a necessity in our daily lives. There are two key areas of development in the next few years, firstly to extend the reach of  Cloud  Services  to  a  wider  population  with  improved  Internet  access,  and  secondly  with advancements  in  Edge  Computing  we  will  see  scalability  to  meet  growing  demands  of  new technology and applications on the Cloud, particularly in the field of IoT (Internet of Things). <br><br>
                      Cloud Services will become more accessible with advancements in Internet Access to a larger global  population.  Traditional  cable  internet  connections  require  a  trunk  of  underground network cables, meaning many larger rural areas and low-income nations don’t have access to cost effective high-speed internet which is required for access to many of the Cloud services. It is currently estimated that half of the world's population does not have access to the Internet. With  developments  in  low  earth  orbit  satellites  aiming  to  provide  Internet  access  through projects such as Starlink, we will see Internet access become more readily available to even the most remote locations and deliver Cloud Service solutionsto a wider population.  <br><br>
                      Advancements  in  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  field  will  see  newer  technologies  developed directly into Cloud Services. The continued development of more IoT applications and services will  become  vital  for  our  everyday  lives.  According  to  Innovecs  “The  total  number  of  IoT connected devices over the globe is predicted to be more than 75 billion by 2025.” (The Future of Cloud Computing: Benefits and Trends, 2022). As IoT devices become more advanced and increasingly relied upon, this places a higher burden on bandwidth, performance and latency expectations  on  the  Cloud  Services  these  devices  connect  to.  This  is  driving  the  concept  of Edge Computing.  <br><br>
                      Developments in Edge Computing will bring information processing and data storage closer to the source of the data (IoT devices) will help alleviate performance issues. Edge Computing brings “applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local servers. This proximity to  data  at  its  source  can  deliver  strong  business  benefits:  faster  insights,  improved  response times and better bandwidth availability.” (What Is Edge Computing, 2022). An example use case  for  Edge  Computing  would  be  in  self-driving  cars,  where  real-time  data  processing  is critical. If the car had to send data to the cloud to be processed and wait for a response to be received, it would be far too slow to prevent many fatal accidents. Edge Computing will process and maintain time-critical data directly in the car with little or no network latency, providing fast enough responses to prevent many accidents. The Edge Computing device will then only send and receive non time-critical data to the cloud, this leads to a reduction in the amount of data  travelling  over  the  network  and  reduced  cloud  storage,  which  in  turn,  increases  data security and lowers the cost of bandwidth.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <i> WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT? </i> </h4>
                  <p> There is likely to be a substantial economic impact with improvements in Internetaccess to remote regions and low-income nations. It will provide this population with the ability to access cloud services that many of us currently take for granted and use on a daily basis such as online banking, e-learning, government, and healthcare services. These regions would also have the opportunity to earn an income by offering products or services online, or simply getting access to education through online resources to increase their chances of attaining future employment. With an online presence, this could lead to new jobs in previously offline regions as it provides these regions with the ability to create new online business or expand existing businesses with an online presence. While I don’t believe this will make any current technologies redundant, it will increase the level of competition with current Internet Service Providers which should lead to a reduction in the cost of Internet access and further increase the level of accessibility. <br><br>
                      Edge  Computing  will  allow  the  rapid  development  ofIoT  devices  to  continue,  particularly devices that have a critical requirement on extremely low to no network latency. We are likely to  see  more  IoT  devices  seamlessly  intertwined  within  all  of  our  daily  lives.  With  the  Edge Computing market “growing rapidly at a CAGR of over 30 percent and is expected to reach almost  USD  7  billion  within  the  next  five  years.”  (Edge  Computing:  The  Next  Big  Thing,2018), this will inevitably create new jobs.As we continue to see more IoT devices developed this is likely to create new jobs as there will be an increased demand for technically skilled individuals.  On  the  contrary  if  existing  industries  or  manufacturers  don’t  begin  exploring adding smart functionality in their products or services, they run the risk of being replaced or made redundant if an equivalent IoT enabled device or service becomes available.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <i> HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU? </i> </h4>
                  <p> As we continue to see more applications and services created or move to theCloud and more enterprises and businesses embrace Cloud Services for their operational activities, it opens up the option of a remote workforce. This will increase the reliance on a reliable and fast Internet connection  as  we  will  undoubtedly  see  increases  in  data  traffic.  While  I  don’t  see  the improvements in Internet access via low earth orbit satellites affecting my daily life, nor the daily lives of my family and friends, I do however see some of the potentials that it does open up. Such as the opportunity to continue my current employment in a remote location and stay connected  with  family  and  friends  through  online  services  such  as  social  media  and  online communication  tools.  Locations  that  were  previously  not  accessible  through  traditional broadband infrastructure. <br><br>
                      As new IoT devices continue to be developed with the support of Edge Computing, it will start to affect all of our daily lives as we become more connected and reliant on these smart devices. One area where I see this already affecting my day-to-day life is with Smart Home type devices, currently with voice assistants, smart doorbells, smart cameras and smart lights, I am already starting  to  see  times  when  bandwidth  and  network  latency  are  an  issue  with  delays  in notifications for doorbellsand cameras. As the list of devices continues to grow with additional IoT devices, it is likely to raise more performance issues. Integrating Edge Computing with more IoT devices will be critical in ensuring our smart devices continue to work in a seamless manner.

                  <h3> CYBERSECURITY </h3>
                  <h4> <i> WHAT DOES IT DO? </i> </h4>
                  <p> The internet is a boundless network that connects computers and its millions of users around the  world.  Through  the  internet,  people  are  now  capable  of  sharing  unlimited  amount  of information and data as well as allowing us to clearly communicate in real-time from anywhere around the world that has access to internet connection which became an integral part of our everyday life. It has undeniably become the best source of a variety of information to keep up-to-date  with  the  newest  trends  and  latest  news  about  any  topics  you  can  possibly  think  of  a great source of entertainment for free or at a cheap cost, and of course, online shopping where it  allows  users  to  buy  and  sell  any  goods  and/or  services  in  just  a  few  click  of  the  mouse. However, with great opportunities and benefits comes with the inevitable disadvantages such as  privacy  exposure  and  public  humiliation,  fraudulent  activities,  viruses/malware,  online threatening or harassment, and many more. <br><br>
                      Due to the exposure that comes along with the excessive use of Internet, Cybersecurity was introduced  to  counter  digitalized  attacks  in  the  web  that  could  potentially  cause irreparable damage  that  is  detrimental  to  the  society.  Cybersecurity  refers  to  the  body  of  technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access(De Groot, 2020)-a dedicated practice that is now used by a vast majority of individuals and corporations to provide a strict security posture against various malicious  attacks  that  aimto  destroy,  alter,  delete,  access,  or  extort  user’s  systems  or  an establishment’s sensitive and confidential information and data to be used in a harmful manner. Nonetheless, the expanding volume and sophistication of attack techniques and cyber attackers heightens the problem even further as well as continuously challenging the strategies being put against  it,  hence,  the  importance  of  cybersecurity  and  its  related  communities  continues  to strive and evolve as new technologies emerge, and as technology is used in new or different ways,  new  attack  avenues  are  developed  and  keeping  up  with  thesefrequent  changes  and advances in attacks, as well as updating practices to protect against them can be challenging which then leads to ensuring all elements of cybersecurity are continuously updated to protect against  potential  vulnerabilities  that  can  beespecially  difficult  for  smaller  organizations without the proper capable staff or in-house resources(Shea, et al., 2021). Additionally, there are numerous vendors and tools that offers a variety of security products and/or services. <br><br>
                      According to Tech Target, common security tools and systems include some of the following: <br>
                      •Identity   and   access   management (IAM): include   single   sign-on,   multifactor authentication, privileged user accounts, and user lifecycle management. <br>
                      •Firewalls:a gatekeeperthat helps monitor and protect you network to block unwanted traffic  and  serve  as  a  barrier  to  outsiders  trying  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  your computer.<br>
                      •Endpoint protection: helps get rid of targeted attack and advanced persistent threats that anti-virus software’s can’t eliminate. <br>
                      •Antimalware: a  software  created  to  protect  information  and  data  that  runs  in  the background. <br>
                      •Intrusion   prevention/detection   systems   (IPS/IDS):a   technology   that   identifies suspicious  activities  that  will  either  detect  or  prevent  it  from  gaining  unauthorized access. <br>
                      •Data  loss  prevention  (DLP): a  practice  that  detects  and  prevents  data  exfiltration, breaches, or unwanted destruction of confidential and sensitivedata. <br>
                      •Endpoint detection and response: a security system that monitors the collection of data in real-time, which detects and investigate suspicious activities. <br>
                      •Security information and event management (SIEM): a software that offers real-time analysis and track records of security alerts and activities generated from applications and network hardware. <br>
                      •Encryption tools: software’s that ensures privacy regarding personal date. For example, VeraCrypt, BitLocker, WhatsApp, Encrpyto, and many more <br>
                      •Vulnerability  scanners:a  critical  security  practice  that  organizations  use  to  detect potential threats and weaknesses. For example, beSECURE, Acunetix, Frontline, and many more.  <br>
                      •Virtual private networks (VPNs):a private connection that is encrypted by disguising your  online  identity  which  makes  it  difficult  for  third-parties  to  track  and  steal  and individuals’ data online.  <br>
                      •Cloud workload protectionplatform (CWPP):a workload-centric solution that protect workloads in any modern environment across multiple providers. <br>
                      •Cloud   access   security   broker   (CASB):a   cloud-hosted   software   that   allows organizations to use the cloud safely while guarding confidential and sensitive data.<br><br>
                      And  well-known  cybersecurity  vendors  include  Check  Point,  Cisco,  Code42,  CrowdStrike, FireEye, Fortinet, IBM, Imperva, KnowBe4, McAfee, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Rapid7, Splunk, Symantec, Trend Micro and Trustwave(Shea, et al., 2021).

                    <p> Society  has  been  more  reliant  than  ever  to  technology  which  causes  the  importance  of Cybersecurity  to  soar  in  such  great  lengths-it  made  a  huge  impact  on  societies  businesses, healthcare, human rights, and the whole economy. Given the intrinsic nature of cybercrimes, consumers  now  have  high  expectations  regarding  rapid  innovation  of  security  measures. Considering   the   fact   that   facing   difficulties   when   it   comes   to   detecting   threats,   all organizations, regardless of their size, has now been adamant in implementing proper training to all staffs to combat cyber threats in its early stages to further mitigate any form of damages from  small  data  breaches  to  large  ones  as  human  error  is  the  most  common  reason  for  data breach  incidents.  Additionally,  the  average  cost  of  security  breach  does  not  come  cheap, therefore  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  cost  of  simply  just  protecting  a  business  with  any cybersecurity form can be expensive, thereby in return, ensures the safety of the businesses’ data and customers’ reliability also increases, implicating that there is also a financial impact as there is a social impact. <br><br>
                        As most of us are sleeping, cyber threat continues to grow and new forms and techniques of cyber-attacks  has  emerged-therefore,  individuals  with  hardware  and  software  skills  and cybersecurity  awareness  are  in  demand.  A  call  for  IT  professionals  and  specialists,  such  as security engineers, data protection officer, security analysts, chief information securityofficer, penetration testers, threat hunters, cryptographers and security administrators, andmany more is  now  needed  to  fulfill  security  roles  to  oversee  IT  security  department’s  operations, implement security programs, execute and apply high quality control in an IT infrastructure, test  multiple  security  systems,  networks  and  applications,  and  uncover  vulnerabilities  and attacks to mitigate potential damages that could compromise a businesses’ integrity. However, another challenge is the shortage of qualified cybersecurity personnel. Nonetheless, it can also be considered a great opportunity for many individuals as it creates job opportunities which can lead to a stable career that is guaranteed to not be replaceable anytime soon.

                    <h4> <i> HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU? </i> </h4>
                    <p> In this fast-paced, digital age, technology has become crucial and integrated inour everyday lives,  nearly  everything  we  do  has  a  connection  to  a  computer  and  the  internet  making  us heavily dependent on it, as well as leaving us vulnerable to some risk if not used with proper caution and awareness of what it can do to harm us. It hasundeniably affected our everyday life  immensely  in  a  good  way-it  helped  us  communicate  easily  anywhere  from  around  the world,  provide  great  source  of  entertainment,  give  easy  access  to  banking,  shopping, transportation,  and  even  check  our  medical  prescriptions  and  histories  which  made  our everyday  life  way  too  easier  than  it  was  before.  Contrariwise,  one  of  the  most  common misconceptions related to Cybersecurity is the fact that hackers only go after big companies as it  is  not  the  case  because  size  doesn’t  matter.  As  any  individual  is  attractive  to  hackers regardless of their race, gender, age, and/or religion as long as the said individual has a login detail, takes card payments, data of clients, or even just phone numbers and email addresses which includes nearly everyone in the world including you, your family, and your friends are vulnerable to cyber humiliation/bullying, identity theft, frauds, scams, and invasion of privacy. <br><br>
                        Nonetheless, there are countless of knowledge free, easy to use, and available from the internet when  it  comes  to  protecting  yourself.  You  can  always  start  with  creating  a  complex  high strength password by making it longer or by changing it frequently as well as adding double verification in order for a user to grant access. It isalso ideal to restrict yourself with clicking on malicious link or attachments send via email, links disguised as downloadable content which is a way for hackers to infiltrate a user’s system. By focusing on these behaviours and applying certain  practicesin  our  everyday  life,  it  will  become  a  strong  foundation  that  keeps  your precious data safe from harm’s way.

                    <h3> MACHINE LEARNING </h3>
                    <h4> <i> WHAT DOES IT DO? </i> </h4>
                    <p> Machine learning can be described as a “branch of artificial intelligence and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving  its  accuracy”  (IBM  Cloud  Education  2020).  More  specifically,  machine  learning describes  any  technology  that  allows  any  computer  system  to  ‘learn’  or  improve  the predictability of its algorithms without human intervention by exposing a computer system to large, ever-evolving data sets (Expert.ai Team 2020). <br><br>
                        Machine  learning  appears  to  be  playing  an  ever-increasing  role  across  a  surprisingly  wide variety of sectors. For example, Marius (2020) points to a number of use-cases which rely on state-of-the-art   machine   learningmodels   including   ‘semantic   segmentation’,   ‘image classification’,  and  ‘object  detection’,  within  images.  These  three  technologies  allow  the sensors in modern self-driving vehicles to safely navigate complex road systems in high traffic. Marius  also  pointsto  machine-learning  as  being  the  backbone  behind  recent  technological advances in written-text analysis, allowing chatbots, spam filters, and automated social media moderation to perform with ever-increasing efficiency. Likewise, machine-learning continues to  play  an  integral  role  in  the  growth  of  online  content  delivery  and  e-commerce.  As  an example,  Spotify  uses  the  listening  data  of  its  roughly  two-hundred-and-forty-eight-million current subscribers to feed machine learning models that enable Spotify toprovide better artist, playlist, and podcast recommendations to its users in an attempt to provide a more engaging user experience and drive consumer loyalty (Spotify Engineering 2020). Machine learning is also playing a major role in the security and intelligence sector and has coincided with a rise in  what  is  known  as  ‘predictive  policing’.  In  this  scenario,  machine  learning  uses  historical datasets  to  provide  predictive  analysis  around  individuals  or  geospatial  areas  exhibiting  an increased probability of criminal activity (Meijer & Wessels 2019, p. 1032). <br><br>
                        According  to  experts,  machine  learning  technology  is  evolving  at  an  extremely  rapid  pace, making predicting its future extremely difficult. However, most machine learning practitioners point to the technology playing a pivotal role in the future of robotics, artificial intelligence, search-engine  optimisation,  increased  consumer  personalisation,  and  predictive  analysis (Slupski & Kurasinska 2021). Isaksson (2020) expands on this line of thinking, explaining that machine learning will benefit from the global adoption of 5G technology and the ‘internet of things’ by allowing machine learning technology to play a greater role in the development of smaller consumer products. <br><br>
                        At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  some  experts  point  to  advances  in  quantum  computing  as being necessary before machine learning models can truly evolve. Thiyagarjan (2021) supports this argument by stating that “the introduction of quantum computing into machine learning would  metamorphose  the  domain  completely.  This  implies  that  in  a  tiny  split  moment, complicated issues that we may not have the capacity to tackle with conventional methods, and existing technologies may well be done so”. <br><br>
                        Finally, some machine learning practitioners believe that machine learning will likely become more automated in the coming years. As it stands, machine learning often requires significant human interaction when feeding data into a machine learning model, with critics arguing that machine learningmodels suffer from the fact that the product of a machine learning model will only  ever  be  as  good  as  the  data  it  is  based  on  (Scannell  2019,  p.  107).  With  this  in  mind, Zhydik (2021) believes that the future of machine learning will rely heavily on the increased automation of data-cleaning and processing, which will allow machine learning algorithms to run more efficiently in the future.
                    </p>
                    <h4> <i> WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT? </i> </h4>
                    <p> There is significant debate about whether or not the future of machine learning will result in a net positive or negative for society as a whole. Critics of machine learning point to its role in the development of more advanced forms of robotics and artificial intelligence, which some commentators believe could cost millions of jobs in advanced economies. This line of thinking is  best  encapsulated  by  Semuels  (2020),  who  argues  that  advances  in  robotics  and  artificial intelligence  supported  by  machine  learning  models  could  endanger  millions  of  jobs  in  the United States as companies look to lower overheads as they recover from the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Jain (2021) largely supports this notion as well, and highlights that  a  disproportionately  high  number  of  low-income  workers  will  be  impacted.  More specifically, it is likely that individuals working in food service and office support roles are most at risk. Likewise, Jain’s analysis suggests that workers located outside of major cities will be  placed  at  risk  unless  internet  and  data  transfer  infrastructure  is  provided  to  rural communities, allowing them to participate in an increasingly digital economy. <br><br>
                        However,  not  all  commentators  share  this  negative  outlook  as  many  believe  that  increased adoption  of  machine  learning  technology  will  coincide  with  a  rise  in  vacancies  for  jobs  in Information Technology disciplines such as data science, software engineering, and robotics (Gupta  2021).  Further,  it  can  be  argued that  many  sectors  will  benefit  significantly  through machine learning, allowing existing practitioners to work more efficiently and provide a much more personalised service to consumers. One such sector likely to be impacted in this way is healthcare,  where  machine  learning  can  use  patient  data  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  patient treatment, predictive diagnosis, and epidemic control (SPD Group 2022).
                    </p>
                    <h4> <i> HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU? </i> </h4>
                    <p> Machine learning is somewhat of a paradox in that it is more than likely that it will continue to play  an  ever-increasing  role  in  our  lives,  while  staying  almost  invisible  in  nature.  In  more noticeable  ways,  machine  learning  algorithms  used  by  online  retailers  such  as  eBay  and Amazon, as well as content providers such as Netflix andSpotify will continue to improve. In turn, these retailers and service providers will be able to better predict our interests and can provide increasingly curated content. Likewise, as noted above, machine learning has a huge role  to  play  in  sectors  as  healthcare,  where  the  benefits  of  accurate  predictive  analysis  will undoubtedly result in a net positive for society. <br><br>
                        While advances in content curation and healthcare technology are well-intentioned, there is the potential for an overreliance on machine learning to have significant, negative consequences. For example, in an analysis on machine learning’s potential impact on security and policing practices, Scannell (2019, pp. 107-117) argues that while anecdotal evidence may suggest that machine learning is capable of removing human bias, this is unlikely to be the case in practice. Machine  learning  databases  rely  on  data  provided  by  human  beings,  as  a  result  the  datasets used in machine learning models will likely contain the same problematic biases that infiltrate human cognitive behaviour. Obviously, this can have dire consequences when talking about machine learning’s potential in the security sector, where already marginalised communities may have legitimate causes for concern. However, similar issues may creep into other sectors as  well.  Machine  learning  algorithms  have  the  potential  to  create  feedback  loops  whereby individuals are only served content or products that have been carefully modelled and selected by a computer system. An individual then interacts with these products and further validates the machine learning model, which then serves more of the same again. <br><br>
                        With this in mind, machine learning will undoubtedly play a major role in the near future within the Information Technology sector and has the enormous potential to provide a great deal of good to a great number of people. However, like all things, it must be used carefully and in moderation.
