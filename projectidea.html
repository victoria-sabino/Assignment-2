              <h3> GERD Health & Fitness </h3>
              <h4> <b> Overview </b> </h4>
              <p> App development can be used for a wide varietyoftopics both good and bad. For this group project, wehave focused on the creation of an app that helps people with a specific health condition (gastroesophageal reflux, or GERD for short). <br>
                This app will have a variety of functions, including: <br> <br>
                -Monitoring the persons symptoms and helping them to find outwhat foods they can and cannot eat. <br>
                -Providing feedback based on the above criteria. <br>
                -Providing valuable information on GERD, as well as treatment for aiding in their recovery. <br>
                -Hosting a meal planning nutrition calculator to assist those with GERD to not just find foods they can and cannot eat, but also to set up a healthy diet, assisting the user to monitor nutritional intake. <br>
                -Assisting the user withfitness specific,diet-basedinformation, which can aid them in reaching their health and fitness goals in a GERD friendly manner.
              </p>
              <h4> <b> Motivation </b> </h4>
              <p> Our group has a common interest/motivation in our desire to help people in need.Because of this, the opportunity to create an app that could potentially do exactly thiswas too good for us to pass up.One of our group members, Jordan Glen is personally affected by GERD, and has undergone quite a tough time dealing with it, including almost dailypains, regurgitation, nausea, and many of the other pre-mentioned symptoms of GERD, as well as having to change his diet and liquid consumption completely, and even undergo investigative surgery in order to finally be diagnosedafter having suffered with it for the seven years before then,untreated. <br><br>
                GERD is a condition thathas awide array of symptoms, and yet (albeit sometimes requiring the assistance of medication or further surgery)changes in food and liquid consumptioncan have a drastically positive affect on the reduction of these symptoms, and the ability to allow the body to heal before further damage is done. If the person fails to do this they can end up with progressively worsening symptomsand the growth of ulcers on their stomach(Danisa M. Clarrett, MD 2018). <br><br>
                Not only that, but this conditioncan also affect a person’sbody weight,and as such, many sufferers will go on to set fitness goals, that without very specific diet advise, unfortunately will be extremely difficult, sometimes impossible to achieve.The internet and world of phone applications in the present day is vast, however, to the best of our research, there are no applications nor websites that combine all of the functions desired for this app.
              </p>
              <h4> <b> Layout of the App </b> </h4>
              <p> <b> Desription </b> </p>
              <p> Phone applications are one of the most convenient go-to tools, and sources of informationfor the modern-dayperson. Becauseof the fact thatthe majority of people within the first world, and some people in second and third world countries regularly carry mobile devices with them, having this created as an application for a mobile device would increase conveniency, offline access, and give the opportunity to create a more personalized user experience(Tania H, 2019). <br><br>
                In order to include all of the necessary functions, it will be desirable to break it down into three major compartments (or in the app, represented as tabs). The following presents the three major compartments desired; Information aboutGERD, a ‘Diet and Symptoms Tracker’, and a GERD based nutritional meal planner.
              </p>
              <p> <b> Information about GERD </b> </p>
              <p> This tab will be focused on education. It will need to have a few subcategories in order to be user friendly at the same time as covering the different areasrelated. <br><br>
                  The currentideas for these sub-categoriesare: <br>
                  •A list of GERD appropriate and inappropriate foods/drinks, along with a search bar for further convenience, particularly when a person is out shopping. <br>
                  •Information in regard tothe importance of nutrition, given thata GERD based diet can cut out approximately 50% of the types offoods consumed by the average person along with almost all drinks aside from water.Further nutrition-basedinformation may be placed either in this section, orthe third section, the ‘GERD Based Nutritional Planner’. That being said, it could also be split across both. <br>
                  •General pieces of advicefor users of theapp, such as how much water they should be drinking, given that water can help rinse the body of excessive amounts of acid, and various other ways to deal with acid reductionincluding but not limited to eating whilst standing or going for a walk after each mealto reduce the pressure placed on the stomach,having lots of smaller meals throughout the day,as well asusingcertain foods (like rice crackersortwo teaspoons of apple-cider vinegarin waterbefore each meal) which effect theacidityinside the stomach once consumed(PubMed.gov 2008, Healthline 2017, Dr Karen Reed PH.D. 2017, ). <br> <br>
                  Various layouts could be used, however,to continue with a user-friendly look, it would need to be set up in a visually appearing way, perhaps small pictures/icons attached to the options, leading into smaller menus that could be set similarly.
              </p>
              <p> <b> Diet and Symptoms Tracker </b> </p>
              <p> The diet and symptoms tracker would also be one with a few divergent functionswithin. It would feature a diet diary, symptoms tracker, and pop-up advice in relation to such symptoms.GERD is a condition that can affect people differently, with some peoplebeing able to recover from it after approximately a year of doing the right thing by their diet, and for others it can be lifelong. Another variable within this health conditionis that a person with GERD may be able to tolerate certain foods/liquids, such as dairies or other mildly acidic foods/liquids.This is what makes this part of the app so useful, as it will work gather information from the user, comparethe data, and use coding algorithms to predictwhich types of foods are more likely to set someone off. <br><br>
                  The diet diary would be a diary that can be filled in once a day, or to the users liking, that gathers data from the user, used to store and assess the information. Thedata gathered will be the foodsand liquids consumed that day.An important part to this diary would also be the optional ability to add a diagnosis date.This date will be saved, and later taken into account when processing the information. <br><br>
                  The symptoms tracker would operate similarly to the diet diary in the way of also gathering and storing data obtained from the user, however, it would be more appropriately displayed in a checklist formfor the purposes of gathering symptoms, to which that data we cannotafford to have confused and will be essential to refer back to for the advice section of this process.Perhaps a symptom strength chart would be necessary as well. It may alsobe necessary to gather this information daily. The time frames being mentioned will help when planning when to send notifications to the user. <br><br>
                  The next function to be written (in terms of programming functions) will be pop-up advice section. This will take the data gathered from both the diet diary and the symptoms tracker andassess dietary information over the last twoweeks (the period necessary for all of the diet related symptoms to show(Colleen M. Story2017)). If the person has had a number of symptoms within that time period, it will collect the data taken from the diet diary andmove it to a separate functionthat willadd the GERD provocative foods consumed to a “possible” list. If foods within this listcontinue to match up regularly with symptoms,then it will move them from the ‘possible’ listand into the ‘likely’ listand be highlighted to the user.  <br><br>
                  If GERD provocative foodsare eaten a number of timeswith no symptoms shown afterwards, then those specific foods will be moved to the ‘okay_to_eat’ list.The more foods that are gathered in this list,the more accurate the information can be towards discovering which foods to place in the ‘possible’ or ‘likely’ lists.For this reason, the ‘okay_to_eat’ list will need priority over the ‘possible’ and ‘likely’ lists. <br><br>
                  Due to symptomsbeing stronger at the start of recovery, this will need tobe taken into account as well.
                </p>
                <p> <b> GERD Based Nutritional Planner</b> </p>
                <p> The ‘GERD Based Nutritional Planner’is an optional tab, geared more towards those with aspirations to look after their bodies in more ways than just healing their esophagus and reducing their symptoms. This section will also have various sub-sections, with the main being the nutritional planner/ meal calculator, and the subsections being the following: <br><br>
                    •Individual meal planners, that later add on to the main sectionas a daily whole <br>
                    •A section for helpful diet advice/calculations, taking the persons current weight, goal weight, exercise amount,type of exercise,age, sleep, and any previous history of fitness journeys/how they wentinto account(the fitness goals willhelp to establish the individuals body functions, such as metabolism,genetics,and a history of past struggles).This will then present the user with information and charts relevant towards their goals, and tips on how to go about their dietaccordingly, suggesting some of the best GERD tolerable foods to assist with obtaining these nutritional goals.(Brittany Smith2020,Fatima Cody Stanford, MD, MPH, MPA, FAAP, FACP, FTOS 2021) <br>
                    •A backend function gearedtowards calculating the persons recommended nutritional intake, andif they exceed their recommended intake, or go to save their daily meal planner with nutrients outside of their recommendations, then it will be sent to the front end, where a polite message will be displayed to the user, letting them know about this, whilst also suggesting what foods they can add/subtract to fix this. <br>
                    •Progress trackerswhich will be used to assess how their current diet/exercise is going for them anddetermining whether the user appears to be stuck in a progress ‘plateau’. Monthly check-ups will be highly recommended. <br>
                    •Pop-up advice based on the above threesections,giving feedback to the user as to how they can adapt their dietto better their progress and general health and wellbeing. <br><br>
                    Finally, one of the most useful features to the Nutritional Planner, will be the actual planner itself. This will include a search function for individual foods and their nutritional value, (the pre-mentioned) tabs for multiple different meals to be created, and a daily meal planner that gathers allthe data selected for the day, and displays both the daily nutritional intake, and whetherit falls within their personalizedrequirements.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <b> The Tools and Technology </b> </h4>
                  <p> The goal is to create a cross-platform application across Android and iOS devices, to simplify the development process a cross-platformframework will be used to develop the mobile appacross both Operating Systems using a single codebase. <br><br>
                    The Programming Languageof choice for the application will bePython.Although Python is not seen as the most popular language of choice when it comes to mobile app development, it is the team’spreferred language as wehave a limited skillset in Programming.The team is currently learning Pythonand has little experience across other programming languages.  <br><br>
                    A suitable cross-platform framework for developing usingPython is Kivy, which is an “Open-source Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps”(Kivy: Cross-platform Python Framework for NUI, 2022). Withthe use ofKivy we can use a single codebase that works on both Android and iOS devices. <br><br>
                    The app will require cloud storage, we can use AWSfor hosting and storing the data for the mobile app, this will include information about GERD, saveDiet and Symptom tracker information from usersand store the personalized Planner information for users. <br><br>
                    GitHub will be requiredfor our software repositoryto allow the team to collaboratively develop the appand maintain version control. <br><br>
                    To keep the project on track, we will use Jira for Project and Issue tracking throughout the project development lifecycle. This can continue to be usedto also file future enhancements for the app.Atlassian offer a free plan to use Jira for up to 10 users(Jira Pricing -Monthly and Annual Subscription Cost per User, 2022). <br><br>
                    We will also need to have both our Laptop/Desktop computers an Android and iOS device handy for the creation and testing of the application. <br><br>
                    Aside from technology, it would also be helpful to seek advice from doctors, nutritionists, and/orpersonal trainersfor app specific information.
                  </p>
                  <h4> <b> The Outcome </b> </h4>
                  <p> The end result would be the creation of an extremely useful tool for not only people suffering from GERD, and potentially aiming towards health and fitness goals, but also to people who have acid reflux. Acid reflux is closelyrelated to GERD,making it beneficial for people with more than just one health condition(Purna Kashyap, M.B.B.S 2021). <br><br>
                    Whilst the impact of the app is likely to go largely un-noticed by any people who do not suffer from GERD or Acid Reflux, the impact that it could have on those whodo suffer from these conditions could have a dramatically positive effect on their lives, as well as being a crucial stepping point in their recovery.

          <p> Our groups chosen project idea is to create a mobileapplication that can be used to assist people who are currently suffering with gastroesophageal reflux(GERD). GERD is a medical condition that is caused by excessive quantities of acid in the stomach, backing up into the esophagus. It can cause chest pains, regurgitation, IBS like diarrhea, chronic coughing, worsening asthma and more.(Jay W Marks, MD 2021, Mayo Clinic Staff 2020, Pramod Kerkar, MD 2018)
