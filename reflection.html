            <h4> <b> GROUP REFLECTION </b> </h4>
            <li>
              <h3> Jordan Glen </h3>
              <p> For  this  group  assignment,  I  feel  that  we  did  surprisingly  well  both  collectively,  and individually, with Joe Sharratt, Nelson Lay, Victoria Sabino and I splitting the work in an evenmanner and co-operating/communicating effectively. <br><br>
                My personal contributions were writing the Ideal Jobs section (whilst communicating with Joe regardingthe  work  done  in  the  industry  data  task).  I  also  formatted  and  wrote  out approximately 2200 of the 2500 total words in the group project idea, as a lot of the knowledge on this was related closely to a personal issue that I have large amounts of experience in. Nelson Lay assisted me by writing up the ‘Tools and Technology’ section in a very effective manner. <br><br>
                The  third  task  that  I  had  a  hand  in  was  Victoria  Sabino’s  report  on  Blockchain  and Cryptocurrencies. Given that I had already thrown my hand up to do quite a large amount of work, Victoria was more than happy to do the majority of this (being the first two sections), whilst I wrote out the last section (‘How will this affect you?’). <br><br>
                With  thanks  to  Nelson  for  bringing  in  his  friend/past  colleague  ‘Pushpak’,  I  was  able  to interview  him  forour  ‘Interview  of  an  IT  professional’.  After  the  meeting,  Nelson  then transcribed the interview, completing the written section of that task <br><br>
                Peer reviewing was also a common strategy used throughout this assignment.

              <h3> Joe Sharratt </h3>
              <p> This assignment started off a little bit rocky for our group.I was away over Christmas withoutWifiaccess, and we had two team members leave our groupearly on. Having said that, I believe that our group has done an excellent job at rallying together to get this assignment done. I was made to feel extremelywelcomewhen catching up after my holiday and the level of communication between group members has been excellent throughout the entire process. <br><br>
                  I would argue thatthe biggest positive out of this experience has been that all group members did their best to attend all scheduled meetings, and the meetings themselves were extremely productive. Tasks were delegated evenly across the board, and everyone appearedkeen to pitch in and helpif someone had bitten off a bit more than they could chew.Having said that, I felt that Icould have taken slightly better notes during meetings as I found myself having to follow-up with people to remind myself what we were all up to on more than one occasion. <br><br>
                  Whilst nothing about thisgroupproject was particularlysurprising, I was a bit disappointed with the unprofessional conduct displayed by the two members of our group that left suddenlyafter one of them posted a relatively passive aggressive message on our Teams chat. On the other hand, I was really impressed with how everyone else conductedthemselves, and we did a great job of just carrying on with the project. <br><br>
                  If I had to pinpoint one thing that I learnt during this group assignment it would be how effective constant communication can be at keeping people accountable and making sure thateveryone feels included in the group. This is something that I believe all four members of the group excelled at, and it helped maintain a relaxed–and productive –vibe over the course of the last fewweeks. <br><br>
                  Overall, this has been a really fun assignment to participate in and I’m really looking forward to working with this group on future assignments.

              <h3> Nelson Lay </h3>
              <p>The team made a bit of a slow start in this project due to some challenges with schedules over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, however after our individual schedules returned to normality we came together quickly and delegated tasks out evenly amongst the group. An improvement we could have made in this area was finalising the group members earlier. <br><br>
                Another hurdle we hit was receiving sporadic responses from two team members approximately 2 weeks into the project and then suddenly no response at all. This was surprising as these two team members were quite active and seemed very engaged in the first week of the project. The remaining team members (Jordan, Joe, Victoria and I) were able to overcome this by staying calm and continuing to work through the tasks we were each assigned to, all while remaining inclusive of the other two team members and continued to include them in all communications and invited to all team meetings in the hope that they would return to action. When it became apparent we were down to a team of four, we delegated the remaining tasks out evenly and helped each other out when needed. <br><br>
                Overall, the team done a great job in utilising MS teams to maintain consistent communications. We were all understanding of each individuals work/life schedules and ensured we scheduled flexible meeting times to have as many team members join the team meetings as possible. Collectively, the team done a great job in maintaining a down to earth environment and worked together to ensure the assignment was successfully delivered on time.

              <h3> Victoria Sabino </h3>
              <p>Initially, it’s been such a struggle to join a group especially since it was around Christmas and New Years holiday period, I did end up being invited to the group by asking around which was great, but I should’ve asked earlier. The group that we are an on now has been very active, reliable and the communication line is open and clear making it easier to track the progress of our current assignment. Additionally, working in a group gave us access to team feedbacks and diverse perspectives regarding work done that gives us a peace of mind knowing that we can support and encourage each other through the difficulties we face in the midst of an assignment- tackling the tasks and breaking it into parts to be able to delegate roles and responsibilities evenly didn’t became much of an issue compared to what we were initially expecting. <br><br>
                Altogether, working in a group has been a great experience so far. Difficulties to be noted would include unfamiliarity towards using MS Teams as well as trying to navigate it for meetings and such and two team members going awol due to unknown reasons. Nonetheless, the perseverance is evident to the work we have been putting together to make the assignment possible.
