              </figure>
              <p> <b> <i> How Long Have You Been Working in the I.T. Industry? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> I have been in and out of the I.T. industry for the past ten years, with the past nine years being fully involved in development work. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> What Inspired you to get into the I.T. industry? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> I.T.  has  always  been  a passion  of  mine.  I  have  always  been  into  computers  and  stuff,  so  I wanted to learn how it all works and then I took a Uni course in I.T. at Swinburne in Melbourne. That was in 2009 until 2013 and then I started working straight after that. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Awesome! And you enjoy it? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> I love it. You can’t do development work without enjoying it. If you are really not into it, it can be a tough gig. You need to get into it. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Have You Had a Wide Array of Jobs Over Your Career? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> So,  I  didn’t  really  have  to  hunt  for  it,  so  you  could  say  I’ve  been  fortunate  there.  It  just happened. I never appeared for a job interview to find a job. How it all happened was I went for an internship through the University with a subsidiary of Toyota. <br><br>
                  We had this real-world project at the Uni where you actually had to do a project for them which was kind of like a try-out. So, if they don’t want to use their own resources for a project, they will just give that project to the University and students get to gain exposure to the industry. <br><br>
                  The  actual  project  we  worked  on  what  to  develop  the  loyalty  program  and  help  with  the manufacture of their scanners.<br> <br>
                  Then  in  2014  in  Australia,  the  automotive  industry  collapsed,  and  all  the  jobs  went  away because it was too expensive to manufacture a car in Australia. So, the project we were working on was for a retail company and that’s where Nelson and I met.
              </p>
              <p> <b> <i> So, is it Easier to Get Positions in the I.T. Industry Once You Have Established a Name for Yourself? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> Yeah, I don’t really haveto do job interviews anymore. It’s a lot more like this conversationwhere it’s all about the experience I have and the projects I’ve worked on in the past. I have a start-up now and I run that company, so I’ve developed a different skill set with that aswell. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Do You Get to Travel with Your Work? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> Yeah, so for example when I was implementing a NetSuite for a company that had 100-plus stores  Australia  wide.  So,  while  we  were  implementing  that,  we  had  developed  our  own product to support their operations in the business. I got to travel around a lot to train people on our product. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Do You Have an Idea of Where You Would Like to go Next? Or do you Wish to Stay in the Same Department? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> That’s  a  big  question.  I  don’t  know  what  the  future  holds  for  me,  butI’ll  give  you  a  bit  of background of how I got started and how it’s all going. <br> <br>
                  So, I started my own business in 2016. So, the implementation of NetSuite and the development related  to  NetSuite  customisation  is  our  main  product.  We  also  do  development  for  an  e-commerce platform as well. So, when I started this business with a mate it was just the two of us and we had plans to expand. We were hiring people on a contract basis. If we had a bigger project, we’d hire more resources and then get the job done and release them. <br><br>
                  Then in 2020 I came back to India for a holiday to see my family. In March, the pandemic hit, and  I  haven’t  left  India  since  because  of  the  whole  pandemic  situation.  I’ve  used  it  as  an opportunity though to set up an office here and I’m hiring full-time resources, training them, and working on projects. <br><br>
                  So, the plan is to be in the industry and do projects. But jobwise, I’m not too sure if I want to look for a job and work for someone else.
              </p>
              <p> <b> <i> That Sounds Very Flexible. </i> </b> </p>
              <p> Yeah,  I mean  the  I.T.  industry  overall  is  kind  of  flexible  because  it’s  the  only  real  stable industry. If you think of it, we are the only people who are all still in jobs. We are very fortunate considering the situation here. One a few industries are like that where there’s been an indirect impact, rather than a direct impact. So yeah, we’ve been really fortunate. </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Do  You  Think  There  Will  Ever  be  a  Stop  in  the  Growth  of  I.T.  Technologies  Due  to  the Pandemic? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> As  I  mentioned,  it  has  had  an  indirect  impact,  but  not  a  direct  impact. So,it  won’t  stop  the growth of the entire industry. <br> <br>
                I’ll give you an example. If we are doing development for the retail industry, or if we are doing development for the construction industry. If these people don’t have work, the first thing they will do is cut off their extra expenses like the ICD department or cut down their development hours. <br> <br>
                But the development doesn’t stop. If you think of it from the I.T. industry perspective. Like, Oracle  let’s  say,  they  wouldn’t  stop  their development.  Or  Apple,  they  wouldn’t  stop  their development. You’ll still get updates for iOS. But maybe some of the I.T. support staff might get let off or something. But I don’t think development will ever stop entirely.
              </p>
              <p> <b> <i> Do You Have Any Advicefor CurrentI.T. Students? </i> </b> </p>
              <p> Different people used to tell me different things. Some people would say there are no jobs in the network side of things and that I should switch to software. And then people would say there are no jobs in software and that I should switch to networking. Everyone has a different perspective. <br> <br>
                  But, if you have a deep passion for the industry, there are jobs everywhere. You just need to be the best as what you do. <br> <br>
                  So, if you’re on the development side, you really need to have that passion to develop your skills and you need to keep an open mind. You really need to have a constructive and creative mindset to be able to develop something new. <br> <br>
                  But  definitely  don’t  listen  to  people  when  they  try  to  put  you  down.  There  are  plenty  of opportunities out there.
               </p>
               <p> <b> <i> So Just Follow Your Passions? </i> </b> </p>
               <p> Yeah, I mean definitely. I’ve noticed that if you are doing something that you’re good at. People say there are not many jobs for pilots for example. But if you are good at it then why not? There are always jobs in every industry for good people. And good jobs too, it’s not like you have to compromise on pay or anything. There are always good, high-paying jobs available. <br> <br>
                  Just keep doing what you’re doing and learn your craft.
               </p>
               <p> <b> <i> So How Valuable is Education vs. Experience? </i> </b> </p>
               <p> This is a great question.One of my mates asked me when we finished uni. He said “OK, I have these two opportunities in front of me, like go for a job or to go and do further study and get a masters”. <br><br>
                   I recommended that he go for the job to get the experience, regardless of what they’re paying you. <br> <br>
                   Ask yourself this question: If you run your own company and you have two people in front of you. One has a master’s degree,and one has two years’ experience. Who areyou going to pick? You’ll obviously take the one with the experience, because experience always matters.
               </p>
               <p> <b> <i> What Are Your Interactions Like with Other I.T. Professionals? </i> </b> </p>
               <p> Being  in  the  I.T.  industry,  obviously  you  will  have  to  work  with ateam.You  can’t  do everything  by  yourself.  Especially  if  it’s  a  bigger  project.  Like  if  you’re  developing  an  app there  are  different  aspects  to  it.  So,  for  instance,  we  developed  app  using the  React  Native platform. What that does is it actually creates an app for both iOS and Android at the same time, so you don’t have to develop an app twice. <br> <br>
                   I didn’t have much time to work on this project, so we hired someone to work on the React Native side of things. Then there’s the other side which is the database side of things. With this project we chose to go with MongoDB which is a cutting-edge database and its real-time. So, when you update something on the mobile side it updates the cloud and then updates all other devices at the same time without you having to do push calls or pull calls. <br> <br>
                   So,  we  hired  someone  for  the  mobile  side  and  then  someone  to  work  with  the  MongoDB platform. I was working on NetSuite by myself and then we hired a quality analyst as well. I do a lot of interaction with quality analyst because ultimately, we would want to know if what we  were  thinking  in  terms  of  development  was  actually  what  was  actually  the  best  way forward. <br> <br>
                   So, I’m working with a lot of people in our team, and then clients as well. Obviously, we’re interacting with the end-users of our app too. I love the interaction with end-users and seeing if the product you’ve developed is actually helping them. I really love how much interaction there is.

               <p> <b> <i> Do You Prefer Working in Smaller Teams or Larger Teams? Which One do you Find to be More Efficient? </i> </b> </p>
               <p> Smaller teams, because you create a tighter bond with each other which helps you work more efficiently. Larger teams are always hard to manage. This is my experience though, but there might be people who enjoy working in large teams and you know that they care about their work. But the smaller teams are capable of looking at the bigger picture during a project, they know what’s happening across an entire project. <br> <br>
                  In  larger  projects,  you  basically  care  about  your  task.  You’ve  been  assigned  a  task  and  you finish that and that’s all you have to do. You don’t have to worry about where the project is heading. With a smaller team, everyone knows where the projectis going,and you can talk to anyone about any part of the project.
               </p>
               <p> <b> <i> Do You Prefer Greater Variety in the Projects You Work on? Or do You Prefer to Focus on a Specific Area? </i> </b> </p>
               <p> As I said, you need to be the best at something. So, I prefer to focus on one area. I have had opportunities  in  other  areas,  but  I  say  no  to  a  lot  of  them  if  they  are  unrelated  to  my  field because I want to stick to doing what I do best. It’s good to be the master of one thing than the jack of all trades. So, I have 8 hours in the day, and I don’t want to spend time learning new things because I.T. is so vast. So, if you subdivide it into like different     departments, there’s networks,  there’s  cyber  security,  software  development,  quality  analytics  and  then  there  is departments  within those  fields.  For  example,  within  software  development  there  are  many different languages and different platforms. <br> <br>
                   Initially I had to find out what I enjoy doing and then once I found that I would want to stick to that. There are so many times when I do struggle myself because I try to project manage things and I do have to things that I don’t want to do. Right now, I am good at development so I would rather someone else handle the project management for me and I would stick to my own field. <br> <br>
                   The advice Iwould give you is, don’t overkill yourself because when you are really passionate about  things,  and  you  really  want  to  do  things.  You  forget  about  the  time.  I  previously  was struggling, like I wasn’t taking breaks on time and I’m sitting at my desk for four hours at a time.  I’m  working  through  the  night  as  well.  I  think  you  should  avoid  that  totally  and  I’ve learned that through experience. So, if you kill yourself working it’s not good, because you want to develop things over the next 30-40 years, not just in one day. <br> <br>
                   There are obviously times when you have to work overtime, but that should be a limited period if there’s something critical coming up, etc.
