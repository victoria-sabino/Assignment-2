              <h3> Nelson Lay </h3>
              <p> I’m  currently  studying  the  Bachelor  of  Information  Technology  course  through  RMIT University and currently live in Sydney, NSW. I have joined the team ‘WhatAboutTheCoders’ to deliver our Team Projectwork assignments. <br> <br> I completed High School at Macleod College in 2002 and enrolled in the Advanced Diploma of Computer Science course at RMIT in 2003. I didn’t complete the course and decided to take a study break. This study break ended up stretching outto over 15 years, where I worked across a   variety   of   roles   and   fortunately   found   my   way   int   the   IT   field,   from   frontline Helpdesk/Application Support, ERP Technical Analyst and Business Analyst roles. <br> <br> My hobbies mostly revolve around staying fit and active, getting outdoors, playing basketball on a weekly basis and play in a team in a local very amateur level competition and have recently started running on a regular basis. Sport is more often than not the genre on the TV, depending on the time of the year it will either be footy (AFL, of course) or basketball.

              <h3> Jordan Glen </h3>
              <p> I am a 25 year old male from rural South Australia, and am currently studying a Bachelor in Information and Technology, as well as a Bachelor in Programming. As part of the Information and Technology course, I have joined a team named ‘What About The Coders’, where we are working together to deliver group assignments. <br> <br>
                My  background  comes  from  humble  beginnings,  having  worked  my  way  up  from  being homeless, to working in two factory jobs, before saving up enough money to attempt to start up my own business (running a general store) whilst trading heavily in cryptocurrencies full time. I did not have enough experience to successfully run the store and soon came dependent on the money I was making trading in cryptocurrencies. I did this for sixto ninemonths before deciding that the up and down nature of passive income was not consistent enough to be doing for a full-time career. I then moved on to working as a security guard, and then into the job where  I  work  currently,  as  an  Agricultural  Bio-Security  Inspector  for  PIRSA  (a  South Australian governmental department). <br> <br>
                The dutiesof my current job, albeit enjoyable, secure, and with mostly good company, are not very challenging, nor in a fieldthat particularly grabs my attention. Having by now done my trading with cryptocurrencies for approximately 5 years and delving further into the world of making money online, I was then led into programming (running large data files/programs and automation).  This  I  found  both  interesting  and  consistently  challenging,  and  so,  being something I do already for a hobby, I have decided to try and make a hopefully lifelong career out of it. <br> <br>
                My other hobbies are in personal development, health and fitness, gaming, martial arts, and almost anything to do with adventuring/exploring.

              <h3> Joe Sharratt </h3>
              <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Security Studies at Macquarie University and am taking the  Introduction  to  Information  Technology  and  Introduction  to  Programming  courses  as electives in the hopes of eventually getting into a data science class later in my degree. <br> <br> I completed a Bachelor of Audio Engineering & Sound Production in 2011 and have worked in the entertainment industry for the past ten years. More recently, I have decided to go back to university in the hopes of transitioning into a career in intelligence. <br> <br> I am originally from the UK but grew up in Sydney. My interests include music, video games, and an unwavering love of my local football club back in England, Nottingham Forest. I also enjoy staying fit and have recently decided to try my hand at trading crypto.

              <h3> Victoria Sabino </h3>
              <p>I’m  currently  studying  the  Bachelor  of  Information  Technology  course  through  RMIT University   and   currently   reside   in   Gold   Coast,   QLD.   I   have   joined   the   team ‘WhatAboutTheCoders’ to deliver our Team Project work assignments. <br> <br> I  completed  my  secondary  education  through  Tweed  River  High  School  and  did  an Introduction to International Business course during my Year 11 at Griffith University to get a guaranteed entry. I completed the course and got a guaranteed entry for two degrees without the need formy ATAR score, however, I wasn’t financially stable to support my studies and
              was  forced  to  work  and  gain  experiences  from  various  roles  inbusiness  and  hospitality relatedindustry.I am now pursuing my passion with computers by studying IT and so far, it’s been great. <br> <br> My  hobbies  mostly  revolve  around  staying  healthy,  listening  to  music,playing  videogames, watching animes, and travelling. Although, I haven’t been able to travel much this past couple of years due to the pandemic,I’m hoping it changes soon.

              <h3> Pesonality Test Analysis </h3>
              <h4> Nelson </h4>
              <p>
                Nelson is the ‘Adventurer’ personality type known for kindness, creativity,and down-to-earth attitude. All of which are invaluable in working in a team. Adventurer types also suggest they are eager learners and passionate problem solvers. He enjoys working with equals and giving advice  in  order  to  solve  practical  problems.  Nelson  leans  slightly  more  towards  being  an introvert, which means in a group team setting he may at times hold back from speaking up and let others do more of the talking. Working in a team with a good balance of introverts and extroverts is ideal. <br> <br>
                The  tests  also  suggest  that  Nelson  is  a  Tactile  learner,  finding  he  learns  better  after  getting practical exercises and prefers to engage with others in a practical hands-on way. This may be through  screen  sharing,  where  we  can  see  each  other  working  in  real-time  or  have  a  visual component to it rather than just straight verbal communication.
              </p>
              <h4> Jordan </h4>
              <p>
                Jordan  is  the  ‘Assertive  Debater’  personalitytype,  which  depicts  Jordan  as  quite  the  open-minded and passionate debater, although with a tendency to unintentionally "step on people’s
                toes" in the process. Meanwhile, the 'My Learning Styles Quiz' indicated that Jordan is a fairly broad learner,  in  that  he  came  back  with  30/30/40  results  for  auditory,  visual,  and  tactile learning, with a slight lean towards the tactile area. In summary, the tests indicate that Jordan is open minded and innovative, always desiring to see topics from both points of view. This relates a reasonable amount to the results of hisfirst test, '16personalities'. <br> <br>
                These  results,  indicate  that  whilst  Jordan  can  have  tendencies  to  be  domineering,  albeit unintentionally, he is a dedicated learner, always having a strong desire for self-development and ingenuity. With his broad range of knowledge across many interests, he can sometimes tend totake over in team-work situations, or naturally desire to be the leader. However, he is also  open-minded  and  has  the  ability  to  quite  happily  restrain  himself  if  there  is  a  better potential leader to elect. In working in a team setting, Jordan is conflict avoidant, and prefers to be tactful and polite in dealing with conflict.
              </p>
              <h4> Victoria </h4>
              <p> The Myers-Briggs Test, suggest that Victoria is a ‘Mediator’ (INFP-T) type personality that strives  for  constant  improvement.  The  test  also  shows  that  she  is  greatly  associated  with empathy, generosity, and open-mindedness which the team genuinely believe to be good traits for an individual. These traits are undeniably great when working in teams seeing as Victoria can give a good amount of support to the team whenever it is need. However, it also indicates that  Victoria  can  tend  to  be  self-critical,  unfocused,  and  may  have  the  urge  to self-isolate sometimes as her energy levels can drain quite quickly especially when in a social setting where there is a heavy load on interaction. To avoid being misunderstood, at a team setting the most Victoria can do is give notice in advance of when she feels her energy levels are about to drop. The team are aware of this and will accommodate by setting meetings at appropriate times of the day for as many members as possible and keeping the meetings short and to the point.
              </p>
              <h4> Joe </h4>
              <p> Joe  is  the  ‘Diplomat,  Confident  Individualism’  personality  type  and  has  always  found  that teams are at their best when there is a diverse set of personalities working cooperatively. With that in mind, he would look to team up with more extraverted people from a diverse range of technical or intellectual backgrounds. Based on the personality test results, it suggests that Joe is a tactile learner who find it easier to remember things after actively completing the task at hand. He enjoys working with highly adaptable people who thrive in less structured settings as this would provide some much-needed flexibility to his desire to plan out tasks. <br> <br>
              However, while he believes diverse groups are capable of having a hugely positive influence over a project’s outcome, there is always the potential for conflicts to arise. As a result, Joe will look to lean on the conflict resolution strengths highlighted in the Myer-Briggs test results by trying to seek out and resolve points of potential conflict before they become major issues. <br> <br>
              The test results also highlight Joes’ strengths in abstract, complex thought and analysis which I  believe  will  serve  me  well  when  problem  solving  issues  as  they  arise  in  the  project.  An additional  highlighted  strength  is  in  planning  out  complex  tasks  which will  add  a  sense  of structure to the group project.
