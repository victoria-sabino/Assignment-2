              <h3> Ideal Jobs: Indidual Analysis </h3>
              <h4> Joe </h4>
              <p> Joe’s ideal job title is to be a team leader of Intel Operations for the Australian Federal Police Force. This is a position that entails being the leader of a small, well-co-ordinated intelligence team, delivering operational technical analysis locally, nationally, and internationally. Joe is very  eager  to  harness  as  many  related  skills  aspossible  to  qualify  for  this  position  and  is unswayed so far upon beginning his studies into IT and Programming.
              </p>
              <h4> Victoria </h4>
              <p> Victoria  wishes  to  become  a  Senior  Software  Developer/Mobile  Anti-Cheat.  An  interesting role,  which  involves  the  development/adaptation  of  software  to counter  malicious  attempts towards a companies’ multiplayer games, thus preserving the games integrity. Once achieving her  ideal  job,  Victoria  will  work  as  part  of  a  team,  creating  cheat  detection  and  prevention software, ensuring secure coding practices, and working hard to identify the possible impact that various levels of in-game cheating could have on the game’s integrity.
              </p>
              <h4> Nelson </h4>
              <p> Nelson’s ideal job title is to be a Cloud Solutions Architect. In this career choice, Nelson would find  himself  working  as  a  consultant  for  clients,  to  design  and  implement  cloud-based solutions.  Keeping  up  with  evolving  technologies  in  the  fields  of  cloud  related  networking, programming  and  databases,  cybersecurity,  and  automation are  some,  but  not  all  the requirements for this job that keep Nelson interested. Because of this, he still has his mind set towards achieving this goal.
              </p>
              <h4> Jordan </h4>
              <p> Jordan’s ideal job title is to be an algorithmic trader. This is a job that entails creating software for  financial  institutions/large  trading  companies  that  assists  in  trading  in  the  stock,  share, and/or foreign exchange markets. Whilst the interest in this career pathway remains, Jordan is open minded towards other pathways in software development.

              <h3> Ideal Jobs: Group Analysis </h3>
              <figure>
              <img src="idealjob.jpg" alt="Ideal Job Group Results" style="width:700px;height:600px;">

              </figure>
              <p> Through analysing the chart above, one can see that whilst there is a wide array of IT related jobs available, certain capabilities, such as software development, teamwork, and keeping up to date on new technologies can go a long way towards securing many of those positions. With that being said, not all careers in the IT industry (such as Typists or Word Processors) require the above with nearly as large importance as the other roles. <br> <br>
                It was also interesting to see through the “Involves skills outside of IT” row how certain areas of the IT industry have crossovers into other industries such as (in these cases) law enforcement and finance. <br> <br>
                Whilst  security  plays  an  extremely  important  part  of  all  IT  related  jobs,  not  every  role specifically deals with the development of security software. On a general basis, this is because IT professionals work as part of larger teams, with individual roles broken down within that team, and specific people appointed towards the creation of security software, where required. <br> <br>
                Overall,  our  team  is  made  of  six  seemingly  like-minded  individuals,  almost  all  striving  for different, and yet closely related jobs. Almosteveryone who is in this course are also students of the RMIT programming course, and yet we also come from a diverse range of backgrounds (such  as  online  marketing,  experiences  with  blockchain  and  cryptocurrencies,  and  more university related backgrounds such as that of a university tutor), which means that throughout our studies, we will be a team that can bring in strong overall knowledge, and the ability to help each other, not just directly through our experience here at university, but also through outside experiences and knowledge.

              <h3> Industry Data Analysis </h3>
              <h4> Joe Sharratt: Team Leader (Intelligence Operations) </h4>
              <p> <b> Required Skillset: </b> </p>
              <p> <i> General Skills: </i> </p>
              <p> According to the Australian Federal Police (2021), a Team Leader in Intelligence Operations requires  analytical  and  critical  thinking  skills  as  well  as  a  sound  understanding  of  the intelligence process as it relates to policing. Communication skills are also highly desirable, as is  the  ability  to  provide  timely,  written  analysis  to  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.  Further, Intelligence  Officers  are  expected  to  consistently  display  an  ability  to  adjust  to  constructive feedback from both peers and supervisors. <br> <br>
              My  ideal  role  is  fundamentally  a  management  position,  therefore  strong  leadership  and interpersonal  skills  are  required  to  ensure  that  my  team  is  working  efficiently,  often  under prolonged periods of stress.
              </p>
              <p> <i> IT Specific Skills: </i> </p>
              <p> Any analytical role in the Australian Intelligence Community requires a working understanding of  the  I.T.industry.  More  specifically,  an  understanding  of  data  analysis,  management  and visualisation are seen as fundamental considering the huge number of fragmented datasets that make up modern intelligence work. Further, an understanding of programming languages such as SQL, Python and/or Java are desirable as Intelligence Officers are increasingly required to work with (and occasionally build) simple, bespoke programs designed to collect and sort data from ‘open sources’ on the internet (Australian Government,2021).
              </p>
              <p> <b> Has Your Opinion of Your Ideal Job Changed? Why or Why Not? </b> </p>
              <p> After  reviewing  the  data  providing  by  Burning  Glass,  my  opinion  of  my  ideal  job  has  not changed. Despite my job title not being listed amongst Burning Glass’ list of ‘Top Job Titles’, Iam encouraged by the high number of both general and I.T.-specific skills that are desired by both the Australian Federal Police and the I.T. industry at large. In particular, it was great to see  SQL,  JavaScript,  and  Python  all  feature  on  the  Burning  Glass  list,  and  I  will  look  to prioritise these skills to ensure that I am appropriately equipped to take advantage of a wide range of I.T. opportunities if I fall short of achieving my goals in the Australian Intelligence Community.
              </p>
              <h4> Victoria Sabino: Senior Software Engineer, Mobile Anti-Cheat at RIOT GAMES </h4>
              <p> <b> Required Skillset: </b> </p>
              <p> <i> General Skills: </i> </p>
              <p> A  role  like  this  certainly  has  a  big  impact  on  the  company  and  so  naturally  there  are responsibilities that comes along with it such as:  <br>

              <p> <b> Has Your Opinion of Your Ideal Job Changed? Why or Why Not? </b> </p>
              <p> My ideal job choice has not changed. According to Burning Glass the top job title was a Solutions Architect, seeing it as the top job title has helped solidify my decision.

              <h4> Jordan Glen: Algorithmic Trader </h4>
              <p> <b> Required Skillset: </b> </p>
              <p> <i> General Skills: </i> </p>
              <p> •Experience and knowledge of trading in the stock/shares markets,<br>
                  •Strong mathematical skills,<br>

                  After completing my Uni degrees in IT and programming, my goal is to then get a job within the IT industry locally, or online, whilst I enrol in a course for quantitative programming and financial analysis. This should give me the qualifications I will need to obtain my dream job, whilst working in the IT industry will give me better job references.
              </p>
              <p> <b> Has Your Opinion of Your Ideal Job Changed? Why or Why Not? </b> </p>
              <p> I  am  still  a  little  uncertain,  but  that  is  the  advantage  of  the  IT  industry  being  so  broad. Nevertheless,  the  broader  category  that  it  fits  into  (Software  Development)  is  the  general vicinity of where mydreams are focused on. I am an incredibly determined person, and often put enormous amounts of effort into topics I am passionate about.

              <h3> Required Skillset Analysis </h3>
              <p> <i> Required General Skills Overview & Analysis: </i> </p>
              <p> Despite having chosen ideal jobs across a wide variety of sectors, the majority of our group’s ideal  employers  place  problem  solving,  critical  thinking  skills,  and  communication  skills  as highly desirable. Likewise, there appears to be a strong demand amongst our group for high levels of adaptability, and a desire to remain on top of evolving industry trends. While all four members of our group share several common required general skills, there were a few outliers  present.  These  included  leadership  skills,  mathematics,  and  a  sound  understanding  of  the financial markets. <br> <br>
              Interestingly, many of our group’s general required skills rank very highly in the list of ‘Top Generic Skills’ according to Burning Glass Technologies. More specifically, communication skills and problem-solving rank first and second respectively, with critical thinking skills also appearing further down the list. <br> <br>
              Amongst  the  outliers  listed  by  members  of  the  group,  industry  research  ranked  10thand leadership skills ranked 11th, while mathematics and knowledge of the financial markets failed to make Burning Glass’ list.
            </p>
            <p> <i> Required I.T.-specific Skills Overview & Analysis: </i> </p>
            <p> One of the few common threads amongst our group relating to required I.T.-specific skills is the desire to gain a solid understanding in a wide variety of programming languages, with C++, Java, Python, and SQL featuring in skillsets across the group. Aside from these programming languages, the required skills for our group are relatively broad. Some of these skills include database  manage  and  analytics,  knowledge  of  iOS  and  Android  mobile  platforms,  cloud networking skills, and a working knowledge of cybersecurity. Further, slightly more specific skills have been listed including a desire to produce ‘agile project delivery methodologies’, and the promotion of secure coding standards. <br><br>
            As with the general skills outlined above, many of the I.T.-specific skills required by our group generally rank highly on the list provided by Burning Glass. In particular, our group’s strong focus on programming languages is a positive, with SQL, JavaScript, and Python all featuring on Burning Glass’ list. However, it is surprising that many of the skills listed by our group do not  feature  amongst  Burning  Glass’  list,  including  Database  management,  cloud  computing skill and cybersecurity. Likewise, Burning Glass includes a large number of skills that are not required by our group at this moment, with the top three skills being Microsoft Windows, SAP, and Business Management.
